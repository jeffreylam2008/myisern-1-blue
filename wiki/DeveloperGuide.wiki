#summary Developer guide for the MyISERN-XML Program.

= Introduction =
The MyISERN-XML program parses XML files and provides data based on a user's arguments.

= Ant =
Ant is a Java-based build tool.  The following are available commands used in ant.
 * ant -f checkstyle.build.xml

 * ant -f dist.build.xml

 * ant -f emma.build.xml

 * ant -f findbugs.build.xml

 * ant -f javadoc.build.xml

 * ant -f jaxb.build.xml

 * ant -f junit.build.xml

 * ant -f pmd.build.xml

 * ant -f verify.build.xml 

The xml files specified in the ant commands are provided in the download package.

== Tools ==
_Note: Environment variables should point to the directories where the tools were installed in_

CHECKSTYLE: Used to find Java coding violations.
 * Environment Variable: CHECKSTYLE_HOME

EMMA: Code coverage tool used for white-box perspective testing.
 * Environment Variable: EMMA_HOME

FINDBUGS: Used to find bugs in code using static analysis.
 * Environment Variable: FINDBUGS_HOME

JAXB: Verfies that XML files follow a specified schema, and converts XML data into Java Classes and back.
 * Environment Variable: JAXB_HOME

JUNIT: Testing Framework for Java code.
 * Environment Variable: JUNIT_HOME

PMD: Looks for weaknesses in Java code such as overly complicated or dead code.
 * Environment Variable: PMD_HOME

= Enhancements =
Proper parser class to separate command-line checking from the main class.
